# Landing Page Project _Project 2_

`Objective`: Construct a dynamically updating navbar with the corresponding sections added. Once these sections are added, each section will be highlighted once it appears in the viewport. The navbar will also be able to scroll to each respective section.

## Table of Contents

<ul>
    <li>Global Variables</li>
    <li>Helper Functions</li>
    <li>Calling Main Functions Once DOM is Loaded</li>
</ul>

## Instructions/Layout

 <pre>
    <code>
        The Global Variables are declared and passed to the main functions. Once the main functions have the necessary variables, they perform the bulk calculations. Helper functions will help perform side task to assign classes and element behavior.
    </code>

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
